# Smart Grid Forecasting & Anomaly Detection (Dataiku – Sample Project)

This repository demonstrates a sample AI/ML implementation inspired by
smart grid and power domain use cases using **dummy data**.

The project reflects how Dataiku DSS can be used to forecast power demand,
detect anomalies, and enable proactive grid maintenance.

## Business Use Case
Power utilities face challenges due to:
- Sudden demand spikes
- Voltage and frequency fluctuations
- Unplanned outages

This project focuses on predicting demand patterns and detecting abnormal
behavior using machine learning models.

## Technologies Used
- Dataiku DSS (conceptual workflows)
- Python (custom ML code)
- Power BI (for visualization)
- Machine Learning models:
  - Hidden Markov Models (HMM)
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
  - LSTM (conceptual)
  - System Dynamics modeling

## Key Outcomes
- Forecasted power demand under different temperature conditions
- Detected abnormal demand and grid behavior
- Enabled proactive maintenance insights
- Demonstrated 10–15% potential reduction in unplanned outages (simulated)

⚠️ Disclaimer:
All data and models in this repository are created using **dummy/sample data**
for demonstration purposes only. No real company or client data is included.
