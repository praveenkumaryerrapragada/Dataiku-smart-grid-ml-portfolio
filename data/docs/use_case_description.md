## Use Case: Smart Grid Demand Forecasting

The objective is to forecast power demand and detect anomalies
based on environmental and operational factors such as temperature.

Hidden Markov Models are used to:
- Identify latent grid stress states
- Capture transitions between normal and high-demand conditions

System Dynamics modeling helps visualize long-term demand behavior.
